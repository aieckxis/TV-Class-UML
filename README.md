# TV Class in Python
This Phyton program indicates a TV class that includes attributes like the channel, volume, and power state. Additionally, it describes how to operate various aspects of the TV, including turning it on and off, switching channels, and adjusting the volume. A TestTV function is also defined to test the functionality of the TV class by creating two TV objects and executing different operations on them.
